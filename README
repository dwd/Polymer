Hi.

Welcome to Polymer.

It's something a bit like an email client.

More accurately, it's something a bit like an email client would have
been, if it had been written using state-of-the-art technology, circa
1997, and then kept up with everything.

Except Python didn't exist, then.

It's intended to be as fast as buggery, and handle vast mailboxes
precisely as fast as small ones.

Polymer has some unusual requirements, so please take note:

1) It needs wxPython. I'm currently using 2.8.

2) pyOpenSSL is highly, highly, recommended. I use a patched version,
hey-ho.

3) It needs an ACAP server. No, really, I'm not making this up. You can
use mine, if you want - it'll auto-provision, and it's the default. I
have got some support for working without one, I doubt it works.

4) It can use a full Lemonade-spec mailsystem. It likes extensions. I
mention this because it remains the most advanced - in terms of
extensions supported - client in existence, in my not-terribly humble
opinion.

5) There's an XMPP client built in, although it's not much cop.

You'll find that in order to be remotely useful, you'll need to set up
some view filters (Tools->Views...), and to do this youll need to, erm,
type in IMAP SEARCH protocol snippets. Yes, yes, I never got around to
doing the editor.

If you run into problems, drop me a line at mailto:dave@cridland.net, or
alternately xmpp:dwd@dave.cridland.net

The project was originally (and is, nominally) two distinct bits - a
Python protocol library, and the GUI itself. I may yet split it apart
again.

It's GPL licensed - I foolishly accepted GPL inbound, otherwise I'd
relicense to BSD or MIT. I will eventually have written out those parts
and will do that relicensing thing.

In any case, the project's now BSD/MIT inbound.

Enjoy,

Dave
