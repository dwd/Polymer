    <h1>Overview</h1>

    <p>Polymer is an online ACAP-orientated IMAP client. Which probably means next to nothing to you. That's okay, you'll be delighted to know that it means next to nothing to plenty of very serious computer professionals, so you're not alone.</p>
    
    <p>What it really means is that you can read your mail - and quite a bit more - and all your data, configuration, etc is all stored on a server somewhere. Or more than one. Nothing is stored on your computer that we can't get rid of later.</p>
    
    <h2>IMAP - The Internet Mail Access Protocol</h2>
    
    <p>IMAP is relatively well-known. You can buy accounts on IMAP servers, and use them to access and read your email. Many existing clients support IMAP, and I'll lay you a bet that you already have an IMAP client on your computer. The only way you'll lose email is if you "Expunge" the mailbox - that's a menu option in the Mailbox menu with Polymer - so you're very unlikely to actually lose email as a result of using Polymer.</p>
    
    <p>With IMAP, all your mailboxes are stored on a server, and the server remembers which messages you've read, so you can switch IMAP clients very easily. On top of that, you can switch computers very easily, too, and if you only use IMAP, that's one less thing you have to backup on your own computer.</p>
    
    <p>There are lots of different IMAP servers you can install on your own server, too. Many of them are not only free, but extremely full featured, as well. Polymer can take advantage of a full-featured IMAP server, but can operate on the bare minimum, too.</p>
    
    <h2>ACAP - The Application Configuration Access Protocol</h2>
    
    <p>ACAP is hardly ever seen in the wild. You're very unlikely to have an ACAP client on your computer. ACAP says it's about configuration, but that's a little misleading - it can store all sorts of data. Polymer uses it to store configuration, your addressbooks, and your bookmarks, currently.</p>
    
    <p>There are very few ACAP servers. Polymer requires one that is actually compliant with the specification, which narrows things down to two, of which one isn't maintained. Luckily, the one remaining is free.</p>
    
    <h2>Advantages of Polymer</h2>
    
    <p>With Polymer, you will only ever have to configure it once. Just once. No matter how many times you reformat your computer, buy a new one, or whatever. It doesn't matter if you use it from one location or many. The only time you'll have to touch the configuration is when you actually need to change it.</p>
    
    <p>With Polymer, you can access your email, addressbook, and bookmarks from a friend's computer without touching the harddisk - this is known as "kiosk mode" functionality, because it's useful in places like internet cafes, and other places where you don't want to trust the computer, and the people owning the computer don't want you to be leaving stuff lying about.</p>
    
    <p>Polymer is platform independent - so it runs on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux, amongst others. It's extremely fast at getting you to your email - there's no need to wait for lengthy downloads, no need to press obscure "Send and Receive" buttons.</p>
    
    <p>Polymer has nice, neat addressbook searches, and offers you the ability to set an alias, or nickname, on a particular contact so you can find them faster later.</p>
    
    <p>Finally, if you use GPRS and a mobile, I've tried to make Polymer as frugal as possible with its bandwidth requirements, so you can gain access to your email from - almost literally - anywhere.</p>
    
    <h2>Disadvantages of Polymer</h2>
    
    <p>You probably don't want to use Polymer if you have dialup access to the internet - Polymer is focused on reducing bandwidth, not time, and will require the dialup link to be on while you're reading your mail.</p>
    
    <p>Polymer requires ACAP. Most people don't have an ACAP account. (I can help you there, however, feel free to ask me.)</p>
    
    <p>It's still very early days for Polymer. I've been using it for around a year almost exclusively, but I'm not about to force my parents to use it.</p>
