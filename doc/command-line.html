    <h1>Polymer Command Line</h1>

    <h6>Being a quick and rapid overview of the command line.</h6>
    
    <p>Polymer has a bunch of command line options. I've documented (hah!) here the long options - short ones exist too.</p>
    
    <p>Two terms you'll want to know:</p>
    <dd>
      <dt>Stash</dt>
      <dd>Where Polymer keeps usernames, passwords, etc. If it's able to use DIGEST-MD5, then it'll keep hashes instead, which can be used to gain access to the service, but not to get the password.</dd>
      <dt>Cache</dt>
      <dd>Data caches. Removing these should effectively have no effect. Currently, there's only support for caching IMAP data, and nothing else - ACAP data is fetched anew with every startup.</dd>
    </dd>
    
    <dd>
      <dt>--help</dt>
      <dd>Print out an aide-memoire of the options available. This is always current, unlike this document.</dd>
      <dt>--kiosk</dt>
      <dd>Doesn't touch the local disk unless, for instance, you save a file or attach one. So no cache, and no stash.</dd>
      <dt>--mailto</dt>
      <dd>Just process a mailto URL. It'll pop up a composer window prefilled with an interpretation of the mailto URL.</dd>
      <dt>--url</dt>
      <dd>Process the URL supplied. Do whatever seems sensible. Then continue.</dd>
      <dt>--debug</dt>
      <dd>Dump debug information - mostly protocol traces - to the log window. Unless...</dd>
      <dt>--console</dt>
      <dd>... switch logging and debug information to stdout instead.</dd>
      <dt>--fatal</dt>
      <dd>Disable the internal debugger, instead exit immediately. (A normal Python traceback will happen on stderr regardless.) This really exists partly because Polymer generally carries on while displaying the exception, and partly because running with this on makes me fix things quicker.</dd>
      <dt>--ban-imap</dt>
      <dd>Pretend all the IMAP servers don't actually support the following extensions. For example, if you do --ban-imap=CHILDREN,NAMESPACE,ACL,LITERAL+,IMAP4rev1,LISTEXT,AUTH,STARTTLS,CONDSTORE,IDLE then you'll effectively be pretending that every IMAP server you talk to only understands the base IMAP4 specification in RFC1738. (Server Properties will tell you otherwise, but that's only a handful of extra capabilities that Polymer doesn't support...) This is particularly useful if you find either a server that's buggy, or alternately, you find a server that actually does LISTEXT or CONDSTORE, and find that I've mucked it up.</dd>
    </dl>
      
      <p>When running Polymer, it's currently the user's responsibility to ensure that only one copy is run. However, multiple copies shouldn't break things too badly - just wipe the caches sometimes. The exception is where the "other" copies are running with the --mailto switch, in which case they ought to be reasonably safe.</p>
