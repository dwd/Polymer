    <h1>Installing Polymer</h1>
    
    <p>Polymer is distributed in three forms. Firstly, as "tarballs" - or compresses archives. Secondly, as ZIP files, a more Windowzy archive. Finally, as a subversion repository. Only the last is truly Up To Date. With both the repository and the archives, I do try not to relase actual broken code, but this does happen sometimes. In practise, the repository gets more broken versions, but also gets fixed quicker.</p>

    <h2>Windows</h2>
    
    <p>You need:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt><a href='http://www.python.org/'>Python 2.3</a></dt>
      <dd>Python is a scripting language. Polymer is entirely written in Python.</dd>
      <dt><a href='http://www.wxpython.org/'>wxPython 2.5.x</a></dt>
      <dd>Polymer uses the corss-platform wxPython toolkit to provide the user interface.</dd>
      <dt><i>[optional]</i> <a href='http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/'>Tortoise SVN</a></dt>
      <dd>Optionally, you can download and install Tortoise SVN, which will give you easy updates of Polymer, and also allow you to easily make your own changes and contribute them back if you want.</dd>
    </dl>
    
    <p>Unzip the zip file, or use Tortoise SVN to fetch from the repository at <a href='http://217.155.137.62/svn/projects/infotrope/polymer/'>http://217.155.137.62/svn/projects/infotrope/polymer/</a>. You'll want to launch polymer.pyw, probably by double clicking on it.</p>
    
    <h2>Linux</h2>
    
    <p>You need pretty much the same as Windows. The biggest difference is that you probably want the commandline svn, and you probably have Python 2.3 installed already. Oh, and the tarball's easier for you. Just execute polymer.pyw.</p>
    
    <h2>Mac OS X</h2>
    
    <p>You have Python 2.3, most likely. Just install wxPython. I apologise in advance for the bad interface, it's not Mac-like at all. (Buy me a Mac and I'll redo the interface Mac-style.) Execute polymer.pyw, but use pythonw to do it.</p>

    <h3>Note for SVN users</h3>
    
    <p>Sensible usage, especially at this stage, is to use SVN. You'll be able to update Polymer very easily. You may note that what's in the tarballs is actually two projects - Polymer itself and something called the Infotrope Python Library. Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain... But be aware that I do use the library in other places, including for website work and, hopefully, on my mobile telephonic device thingy.</p>
